The goal is to solve a simple React interview question, to build a React app following these rules:
 - A circle must appear where the user clicks
 - Add a Undo button that removes the circles in the inverse order from where they were added.
 - Add a Redo button thats adds back the circles removed with Undo
 - Make the buttons disabled when there is nothing to undo or redo
